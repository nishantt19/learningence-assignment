# Learningence Assignment

In this assignment, I have made the website using Nextjs 14 and I have deployed the website on netlify, for design, I have used nextui for making the card component and the avatar that we have in the bottom of the sidenav, also I have not added any routes for any page, and the button does not have any onClick functionality, I have added the active button functionality to show the video tab differently, we can click on any of the tab and it will take the css properties for active, I have used tailwindcss for styling and typescript.
I have embedded the youtube video for the video shown in the right.
